The Python script calculates the price of a European call option using two different methods: the Black-Scholes formula and a multi-period binomial tree model. The Black-Scholes method leverages continuous-time stochastic calculus and outputs a closed-form solution, calculating key intermediary variables d1 and d2 for standard normal cumulative distribution functions. The binomial model, on the other hand, discretizes the option pricing process into N time steps, constructing a lattice of potential asset prices using "up" and "down" factors based on volatility (sigma) and step time (dt), and iteratively calculates the option price backward through the tree. Input parameters include stock price (S), strike price (K), time to maturity (T), risk-free interest rate (r), volatility (sigma), and, for the binomial method, the number of periods (N). After computing the option price with both methods, the script compares their results and prints the respective prices and the absolute difference between them, highlighting how closely the binomial model approximates the Black-Scholes formula as N becomes large.
