The Python script compares the pricing of a European call option using two methods: the Black-Scholes model and the multi-period binomial tree model. It first defines a function for the Black-Scholes formula, which calculates the option price based on parameters such as the current stock price, strike price, time to maturity, risk-free interest rate, and stock volatility. The second function implements the binomial tree model, calculating the option price through iterative steps across a defined number of periods, using parameters like up and down factors, risk-neutral probability, and discounting future payoffs. The script sets specific parameter values and computes the call option prices for both methods, displaying the results and their difference to analyze the accuracy and convergence of the binomial model with a high number of steps (10,000 in this case). This highlights the trade-off between computational complexity and precision when approximating the theoretical Black-Scholes options price.
